AI-Powered Diabetes Risk Assessment ü©∫ This project is a web-based application designed to predict a user's risk of having diabetes based on key health indicators. It features a machine learning model built with Keras/TensorFlow and a user-friendly web interface created with Flask.

The application goes beyond simple prediction by integrating with the Google Gemini API to provide dynamic, personalized health recommendations for users identified as high-risk, alongside general dietary guidelines.

Features ‚ú® Machine Learning Model: A sequential neural network trained on the CDC's BRFSS dataset, covering over 250,000 diverse samples for robust predictions.

Interactive Web Interface: A modern, responsive two-column dashboard built with Flask and Jinja2 that allows for easy data entry.

Dynamic AI Recommendations: For high-risk predictions, the app calls the Google Gemini API to generate personalized, actionable health advice based on the user's specific inputs.

Static Dietary Guidance: Provides safe, general food recommendations (foods to eat/avoid) for both high and low-risk outcomes.

User-Friendly Design: The interface includes a loading state for the prediction button and organizes results and recommendations into clean, easy-to-read cards.
